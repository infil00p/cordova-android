### Android Studio Scripts

These scripts are to be distributed with the AAR and copied into a standard Android Studio project.  The purpose of these
scripts is to facilitate the installation of Cordova Plugins, and nothing more.  They do not contain any build or run logic, 
since this should be handled by Android Studio and Gradle.
